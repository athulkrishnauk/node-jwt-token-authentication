# node-jwt-token-authentication
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a safe, compact, and self-contained way of transmitting information between multiple parties in the form of a JSON object. Once the Authentication server verifies the userâ€™s credentials, it will create a JWT and sends it to the user. The app now gets this JWT and allows the user access to its data.
